========================================================================

Open nmsVoiceAnalysisRunCPP.sln and run the program to execute the code in C++.

OBS.: If you are receiving the error "An unhandled exception of type 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException'...", make sure that the library project was build with x86 as the target CPU (Project ->Properties). After changing this configuration, rebuild the solution and reapply the command regasm in VS 2008 SDK.
